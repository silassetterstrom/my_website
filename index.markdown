  I am currently a rising senior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Throughout the summers of 2018 and 2019, 
  I worked at Colony Brands, Inc. as a Data Integration Intern, where I contributed to multiple projects and gained
  invaluable experience learning about and then leveraging my knowledge of various AWS technologies. I learned how to
  work in an agile environment, and developed a passion for solving the types of challenges presented by software development.
  
  This summer, I used the experience I gained in my prior internships to led a team of 3 other interns on development of an 
  email management application for underwriters during my TechStart internship at Liberty Mutual Insurance. I honed my 
  skills by learning how to make my code not just functional, but efficient and sustainable long-term through complete 
  unit and integration testing. Beyond the hard skills, I learned a lot about teamwork, communication, and delegation in 
  a virtual work environment.

  This spring, I plan to graduate with a BS in Computer Science and Political Science, and am actively seeking full-time 
  Software Engineering employment opportunities for after I graduate!
