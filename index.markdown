I am currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. As a Data Integration Intern 
at Colony Brands, Inc. for the last two summers, I have worked on multiple projects and gained
valuable industry experience. This past summer, I led development on a web application that 
ported an existing mainframe application to AWS. Working in an agile environment, I learned 
the importance of communicating with the customer and writing good tests, where we used a 
multiple-environment development workflow that required 100% unit test coverage.

This summer, I am excited to work as a TechStart Intern at Liberty Mutual in Seattle. I plan to graduate with 
a BS in Computer Science and Political Science with a Certificate in Leadership in Spring 
2021, at which point I will be searching for full time employment as a Software Engineer.

When I'm not busy with school or work, I am an avid tennis player and fan, and enjoy running and spending 
time outside. I also enjoy playing board games with friends and having deep theological, philosophical, 
and political discussions well into the night.
