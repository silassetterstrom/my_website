            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am currently a junior at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. As a Data Integration Intern 
                at Colony Brands, Inc. for the last two summers, I have worked on multiple projects and gained
                valuable industry experience. This past summer, I led development on a web application that 
                ported an existing mainframe application to AWS. Working in an agile environment, I learned 
                the importance of communicating with the customer and writing good unit tests, where we used a 
                multiple-environment development workflow and required 100% test coverage.<br><br> This summer, I 
                am excited to work as a TechStart Intern at Liberty Mutual in Seattle. I plan to graduate with 
                a degree in Computer Science and Political Science with a Certificate in Leadership in Spring 
                2021, at which point I will be searching for full time employment as a Software Engineer, 
                either in the Madison or Seattle area.<br><br> When I'm not busy with school or work, I am 
                an avid tennis player and fan, and enjoy running and spending time outside. I also enjoy
                playing board games with friends and having deep theological, philosophical, and political 
                discussions well into the night.
