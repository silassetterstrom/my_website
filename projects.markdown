<h3>Underwriter Email Management</h3>
<p>Liberty Mutual Internship, Summer 2020</p>

    -Set up a local H2 database and deployed a MySQL database to AWS to store user emails.<br>
    -Created a Spring Boot API with Maven to read and write to the email database.<br>
    -Sketched a wireframe for the UI and created a skeleton for the front-end that the team used<br>
    -Wrote backend and frontend unit tests with 100% coverage using JUnit and Cypress.<br><p> 
<h3><a href="https://github.com/53nicholsonsam/HeartsPlayer">HeartsPlayer</a></h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Developed a Python application with a Tkinter GUI to allow a user to play the card game Hearts against the computer. Features robust logic that allows the computer to easily beat inexperienced Hearts players and be competitive against experienced ones! It's not quite as fun as playing with real people but it was satisfying to see the computer slowly get closer to beating me (and eventually it did!) as I worked through the logic on this application!<br></p> 
<h3><a href="https://github.com/silassetterstrom/24">24</a></h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Created a command line tool using Python to determine whether a set of 4 numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided to reach the number 24, and return a solution, if there is one. 24 was one of my favorite games to play in school when I was a kid, so this really gave me a kick!<br></p> 
<h3><a href="https://github.com/egabrielse/SimplyRun">SimplyRun</a></h3>
<p>Semester Project for Software Engineering Course, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Developed a mobile application using React Native to track all the important statistics for a user’s run without the unnecessary extras or ads of most mainstream fitness tracking applications. There were 6 members on the team, and I spent most of my time working on the displaying and updating of a user's profile and settings.<br></p>     
<h3>MJCL Web Application</h3>
<p>Colony Brands internship, Summer 2019</p>
<p>Rewrote an existing mainframe application into Java and Python for deployment on AWS.<br>
    -Refactored the process of running a job using a DynamoDB Stream to eliminate API calls and provide instantaneous status updates.<br>
    -Used a multi-environment development workflow by testing releases in dev and promoting to production after a peer review process using version control.<br>
    -Redesigned front-end using Vuetify to utilize standardized UI components.<br></p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/silassetterstrom/Dominion">Dominion Deck Builder</a></h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2019</p>
<p>Created my own card randomizer for one of my favorite board games - Dominion - in Java.
    Allows user to pick which imported sets of cards they would like to use and gives them
    the option to re-randomize or swap out cards.<br></p>
<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
<p>Colony Brands internship, Summer 2018</p> 
<p>Developed an application to provide definitions for all tables and columns in the company’s database.<br>
    -Implemented search functionality and the application’s front-end.<br>
    -Integrated SQL into the application for read/write operations on the MySQL database.<br></p>
