<h3>Underwriter Email Management</h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Led a team of 3 other interns on development of a new email management application to allow underwriters to be more efficient with their time and quickly delegate tasks to their assistants.<br>
    -Set up a local H2 database and deployed a MySQL database to the Cloud to store user emails.<br>
    -Created and deployed a Spring Boot API with Maven to read and write to the email database.<br>
    -Sketched the wireframe for the UI and helped get the environment set up so that other members of the team could implement the design.<br>
    -Wrote backend and frontend unit tests with 100% coverage using JUnit and Cypress.<br><p> 
<h3>HeartsPlayer</h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Developed a Python application with a Tkinter GUI to allow a user to play the card game Hearts against the computer. Features robust logic that allows the computer to easily beat inexperienced Hearts players and be competitive against experienced ones! It's not quite as fun as playing with real people but it was satisfying to see the computer slowly get closer to beating me (and eventually it did!) as I worked through the logic on this application!<br></p> 
<h3>24</h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Created a command line tool using Python to determine whether a set of 4 numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided to reach the number 24, and return a solution, if there is one. 24 was one of my favorite games to play in school when I was a kid, so this really gave me a kick!<br></p> 
<h3>Simply Run</h3>
<p>Semester Project for Software Engineering Course, Spring 2020</p>
<p>Developed a mobile application using React Native to track all the important statistics for a user’s run without the unnecessary extras or ads of most mainstream fitness tracking applications. There were 6 members on the team, and I spent most of my time working on the displaying and updating of a user's profile and settings.<br></p>     
<h3>MJCL Web Application</h3>
<p>Colony Brands internship, Summer 2019</p>
<p>-Led development on project with another intern to port an existing application for running JCL jobs onto AWS.<br>
    -Used an Amazon DynamoDB Stream to refactor and streamline the process of running a job and added a
     new feature to allow automatic chaining of jobs.<br>
    -Modified an existing API to allow users access to error logs when a job fails.<br>
    -Added a feature to email users when they need to take action on a job using an Amazon SES template.<br>
    -Re-designed website front-end using Vuetify to utilize a component library to make future feature
     development faster and make the user experience consistent.<br>
    -Created a new feature in Python allowing one user input to retrieve many attributes from the backend,
     which saved time and reduced errors by eliminating the need for extraneous input.<br>
     Wrote backend code that had 100% unit test coverage; used a multi-environment development<br></p>
<h3>Dominion Deck Builder</h3>
<p>Personal project, Spring 2019</p>
<p>Created my own card randomizer for one of my favorite board games - Dominion - in Java.
    Allows user to pick which imported sets of cards they would like to use and gives them
    the option to re-randomize or swap out cards.<br></p>
<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
<p>Colony Brands internship, Summer 2018</p> 
<p>-Designed and developed an application to provide definitions for all tables and columns in the company’s
        database (with one other intern).<br>-Engineered key features such as the searching functionality 
        in Node.js and many of the frontend features and aesthetics in Vue.js.<br>-Performed operations 
        on the database using MySQL<br></p>
