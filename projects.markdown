<h3>MJCL Web Application</h3>
<p>Project I worked on during my Summer 2019 internship at Colony Brands, Inc.</p>
<p>-Led development on project with another intern to port an existing application for running JCL jobs onto AWS.<br>

    -Added a feature to email users when they need to take action on a job using an Amazon SES template.<br>
    -Re-designed website front-end using Vuetify to utilize a component library to make future feature
     development faster and make the user experience consistent.<br>
    -Created a new feature in Python allowing one user input to retrieve many attributes from the backend,
     which saved time and reduced errors by eliminating the need for extraneous input.<br>
